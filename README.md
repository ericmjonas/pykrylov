PyKrylov
---------


Krylov subspace methods for computing extremal eigenvalues and singular values
from sparse matrices. Many of these are close-to-the-line ports of other
matlab and fortran code originally supplied by the authors. 

Only requires we supply methods capable of computing Ax (and A*x for SVD case)
